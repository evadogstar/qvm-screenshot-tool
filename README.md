# How to use it

You will be asked for actions by GUI prompt.`qvm-screenshot-tool` support `ksnapshot` (KDE5 tool) and now at 0.9+ version `deepin-screenshot` console tool to make screenshots which is not available by default at dom0, but it can by simple installed to it with one command `sudo qubes-dom0-update deepin-screenshot zenity`<br> 
![screenshot png](https://i.imgur.com/h3h1dMW.png)

Qubes Team plan to remove `KDE5` from Qubes by default, therefore `ksnapshot` will be also removed. Accordingly, I highly recommend to use it with `deepin-screenshot`. 

### How to use the tool with Ksnapshot

0. You can start `ksnapshot` first and make your screenshot with it, then start `qvm-screenshot-tool` or you can start `qvm-screenshot-tool` and select `ksnapshot` option at dialog window.
0. After `qvm-screenshot-tool` started. It will popup confirmation dialog. Do not close it, if you are NOT ready to do something with your screenshot at `ksnapshot`! Make screenshot first. 
0. If you are happy with result at `ksnapshot` preview window. Then click `yes` on `qvm-screenshot-tool` dialog.
0. New dialog will be apiared and then you can choose options to upload screenshot etc. (read more below)

### How to use it with deepin-screenshot

All other options on first dialog use `scrot` tool to make screenshots.

0. Start tool with `./qvm-screenshot-tool` or hotkey which you already setup (see install section)
0. Choose e.g. `region or window` 
0. Simple click on window to make screeshot of that window. Drag mouse with left button down to select region of the screen.
0. Then select actions what you want to do with screenshot. e.g. upload it to imgurl server, only it to AppVM or dom0
0. You will be prompted. Select destination AppVM. Throught this VM utility will upload screenshot to imgurl server.
0. Then amazing dialog apear at AppVM window. You will find urls on it. Simple select them with the mouse and `Ctrl+C`them to put to clipboard. 
0. If `nautilus` mode was selected it will be started with `$PATH` opened. If `xcopy` is installeted. Url will be copy to clickboard.

0. Select edit mode (and upload move if need to also upload)

## WARNING! ALWAYS REVIEW ANY CODE THAT YOU UPLOAD TO DOM0 BEFORE DO THAT!
First, you **must** review the code, before upload it to dom0 ! Always do that if you are uploading code to dom0 from some 
other source and other way then Qubes Team recommend it !!!

Discussion thread on the qubes maillist about the code:<br>
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qubes-users/dcsRRPf0Fxk


### Manual install

First install dependencies: 

```shell
sudo qubes-dom0-update zenity deepin-screenshot
```

Then just save `qvm-screenshot-tool.sh` as a file to any AppVM. Then copy it to `dom0` with the following command at dom0 terminal:

```shell
qvm-run --pass-io NAMEOFAPPVM 'cat /path/to/qvm-screenshot-tool.sh' > /home/user/Pictures/qvm-screenshot-tool.sh
```
Then give it execute privilegies at dom0 terminal:

```shell
chmod +x /home/user/Pictures/qvm-screenshot-tool.sh
```

Of course, you can start it for testing purposes from command line:

```shell
./qvm-screenshot-tool.sh
```

It's possible to skip first dialog and make choice from command like with `--region-only` or `--fullscreen` :

```shell
./qvm-screenshot-tool.sh --region-only
./qvm-screenshot-tool.sh --fullscreen
```

Now, you are ready to setup it on some hotkey combination. Go to `System -> Keyboard settings` and bind the script to your favorite shortcut `PrintScreen` key or to e.g. `Ctrl+PrintScreen` combination.



Dependencies
----
Most are probably pre-installed at `Qubes OS` by default.<br>


```shell
sudo qubes-dom0-update zenity deepin-screenshot
```

* zenity
* deepin-screenshot
* **Linux only AppVMs supported**
* curl at Linux AppVM
* zenity at dom0 and at AppVM. 
* scrot at dom0 <i>(recommended) or ksnapshot</i>
* ImageMagick (already at dom0 preinstalleted)
* xclip at AppVM <i>(only need if you want also copy url to clipboard automaticaly att AppVM)</i>

OS support
----
Qubes OS only. :-) 

This will not fully work on Windows AppVMs. Only if Qubes Team will add something like cygwin. But are you really want Windwos support for uploading images to imgurl service? <br>

**Also its is almost ready for GNOME !!!**
